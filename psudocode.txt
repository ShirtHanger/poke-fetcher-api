    I am only interested in a pokemon's biological stats

    Pull request should get the following for now:
        Pokemon name (pokemon.name)
        Pokedex ID (pokemon.id)
        Type (response.types[i].type.name)

            Must make a loop for type array to print BOTH
                Consider adding into string for singular print
            for (type of types) {console.log(type.type.name)}
            Types is an array containing objects

        Height (response.height)
        Weight (response.height)
        Sprite (response.sprites.front_default) 
            Or official Artwork (response.sprites.other.official-artwork.front_default)
        
    Will add more stats as code is finalized if I have time

const meats = ['chicken', 'briskit', 'pork']

for (meat of meats) {
    console.log(meat)
}
